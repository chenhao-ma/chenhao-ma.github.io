== *Bio*

Dr. Chenhao Ma is an Assistant Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong, working with Prof. [https://www.reynold.hku.hk/ Reynold Cheng]. He received his PhD degree from Department of Computer Science in the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2021. He once was a visiting student in the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 2019. Till now, he has published more than 20 papers in the areas of database and data mining, including /one of four *Best of SIGMOD2020*/ (a world flagship conference in database areas, 4\/458), and most of them were published in top-tier conferences and journals (e.g., SIGMOD, PVLDB, and TODS). He was awarded the /*ACM SIGMOD Research Highlight Award 2021*/. He has served as PC members and reviewers for several top conferences and journals (e.g., VLDB, KDD, WWW, CIKM, TKDE, and VLDBJ).
