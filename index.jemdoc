== *Bio*

Dr. Chenhao Ma is an Assistant Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong. He received his PhD degree from Department of Computer Science in the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2021. He once was a visiting student in the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 2019. Till now, he has published more than 40 papers in the areas of database and data mining, including /one of four *Best of SIGMOD2020*/ (a world flagship conference in database areas, 4\/458), and most of them were published in top-tier conferences and journals (e.g., SIGMOD, PVLDB, and TODS). He was awarded the /*ACM SIGMOD Research Highlight Award 2021*/. He has served as PC members and reviewers for several top conferences and journals (e.g., VLDB, KDD, WWW, CIKM, TKDE, and VLDBJ).

== *News* 
 - I am looking for highly self-motivated PhD/MPhil students, PostDocs, and research assistants. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to drop me an email. Please check the *[https://chenhao-ma.github.io/recruit.html position info]*.



== *Interests*

His research interests mainly focus on large-scale data management and data mining:
- Graph data analytics: dense subgraph discovery/search, (shortest) path query, motif analysis and graphlet counting, graph learning.
- AI/LLM+DB: text2sql, dataset search, vector search.
- Traffic data mining: trajectory outlier detection, traffic trajectory search.
